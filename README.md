## FIRST VIEWER TELEVISION

The First Viewer Television is a webpage where the visitor who watches the youtube's videos is the first viewer, because all the videos showed are videos with 0 views.

View it online: <http://www.firstviewer.tv>

## How it works

The VHX player <http://dev.vhx.tv> reads a JSON file generated every 2 hours using the firstviewer.rb class

## Youtube API v3
With the version 3 of the youtube api, a developer key is needed. Here a video about how to grab one <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im69kzhpR3I>. After that, create a file called DEVELOPER_KEY, write there the youtube API developer key and put the file in the same folder of the firstviewer.rb file
