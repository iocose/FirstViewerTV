## FIRST VIEWER TELEVISION

The First Viewer Television is a webpage where the visitor who watches the youtube's videos is the first viewer, because all the videos showed are videos with 0 views.

View it online: <http://www.firstviewer.tv>

## How it works

The VHX player <http://dev.vhx.tv/video-player.html> reads a JSON file <http://www.iocose.org/apis/firstview.json> generated every 2 hours using the firstviewer.rb class

## Youtube API v3

With the version 3 of the youtube api, a developer key is needed <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im69kzhpR3I>. Create a file called DEVELOPER_KEY, write there the youtube API developer key and put in the same folder of the firstviewer.rb file
